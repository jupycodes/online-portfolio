    <h1>Cristina Sabo's Online Portfolio</h1>

    <p>Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio, I'm so glad you took the time to check out some of my previous projects. Before we dive in, I'd like to give you an opportunity to get to know me a litte better</p>
    
    <h3>Activities</h3>

    <p>I was born January 5th on a cold winter day which might help to explain my love for winter sports. I'm an avid skier who loves getting out to the mountains as often as I can. My favourite days are spent in the backcountry, ski touring or perhaps heli-skiing (if strategically timed around a recent Christmas bonus lol). During summer months, I make-do with downhill mountain biking and any other adrenaline-boosting activities that come my way.</p>

    <h3>Education</h3>

    <p>I graduated from U of S with a degree in Chemical Engineering and am currently working through a web development bootcamp offered through the U of C.</p>
    
    <h3>Current Job</h3>
    
    <p>I currently work as a Sustainability Engineer in the oil and gas industry, finding creative solutions to reduce my company's greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

    <h3>Languages</h3>

    <p>I'm quite multilingual. Luckily for me, I learnt from a young age to speak English, Romanian, and Hungarian which has helped me later in life as I learnt French and Spanish. It's also been pretty helpful now as I learn to code in Javascript, Ruby, Python, and HTML/CSS.</p>
